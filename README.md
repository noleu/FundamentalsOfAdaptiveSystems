### Description
CrowdNav is a simulation based on SUMO and TraCI that implements a custom router
that can be configured using kafka messages or local JSON config on the fly while the simulation is running.
Also runtime data is send to a kafka queue to allow stream processing and logger locally to CSV.

### Minimal Setup
* Download the CrowdNav code
* Run `docker run --name kafka --hostname kafka -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --env ADVERTISED_HOST=kafka --env ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 spotify/kafka`  to run a kafka instance
* Run `docker build -t crowdnav .` to build the docker image
* Run `docker run -d -it --link kafka:kafka crowdnav` to run the docker container

### Getting Started Guide
A first guide on how to use (i.e. adapt, measure, optimize) CrowdNav with the [RTX tool](https://github.com/Starofall/RTX) is available at this [Wiki page](https://github.com/Starofall/RTX/wiki/RTX-&-CrowdNav-Getting-Started-Guide). 

### Operational Modes

* Normal mode (`python run.py`) with UI to Debug the application. Runs forever.
* Parallel mode (`python parallel.py n`) to let n processes of SUMO spawn for faster data generation.
  Stops after 10k ticks and reports values.
  
### Further customization

* Runtime variables are in the knobs.json file and will only be used if `kafkaUpdates = True
` is set to false in `Config.py`. Else the tool uses Kafka for value changes.
* To disable the UI in normal mode, change the `sumoUseGUI = True` value in `Config.py` to false.

### Notes

* To let the system stabalize, no message is sent to kafka or CSV in the first 1000 ticks .

* Errors of the form "Error: Answered with error to command 0xc4: Route replacement failed for car-356" are internal sumo errors that are not of our consern as of now. See this thread for details
